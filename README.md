# Awesome Security Resources [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
A collection of tools, cheatsheets, operating systems, learning materials, and more all related to security. There will also be a section for other Awesome lists that relate to cybersecurity.

I seem to forget about all the tools and resources when attacking, defending, responding, or looking to learn about cyber security, the purpose of this is to help fix that.

### Penetration Testing Tools
These tools are broken up into 4 categories. Enumeration, Exploitation, Privilege Escalation, and Miscellaneous.
* Enumeration tools are any tools that help in the process of collecting more information about the target being attacked. 
* Exploitation tools are any tools that help in exploiting the target after it has been enumerated.
* Privilege Escalation tools are the tools that will aid in vertical or horizontal permission change.
